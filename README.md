### Presenting Opencv:
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is released under a BSD license and hence itâ€™s free for both academic and commercial use. It has C++, Python and Java interfaces and supports Windows, Linux, Mac OS, iOS and Android. OpenCV was designed for computational efficiency and with a strong focus on real-time applications. Written in optimized C/C++, the library can take advantage of multi-core processing. Enabled with OpenCL, it can take advantage of the hardware acceleration of the underlying heterogeneous compute platform.

Adopted all around the world, OpenCV has more than 47 thousand people of user community and estimated number of downloads exceeding 14 million. Usage ranges from interactive art, to mines inspection, stitching maps on the web or through advanced robotics.

### Context
In this tutorial we focus on Learning Computer Vision Concepts by making Projects like Handwriting Recognition, Face Filters, Car & People Detection!

### Prerequists
Little to no programming knowledge is needed! I'll be showing you everything you need to know, but basic Python is a plus
You will need a computer running Microsoft Windows, or Linux, or a Mac running OS X.
All the software needed in this course is free and open source! I provide all images, models and classifiers used in this course

### You will learn:
- The key concepts of Computer Vision & OpenCV.
- To perform image manipulations such as transformations, cropping, blurring, thresholding, edge detection and cropping.
- To segment images by understanding contours, circle, and line detection. You'll even learn how to approximate contours, do contour filtering and ordering as well as approximations.
- Use feature detection (SIFT, SURF, FAST, BRIEF & ORB) to do object detection.
- Implement Object Detection for faces, people & cars.
- Extract facial landmarks for face analysis, applying filters and face swaps.
- Implement Machine Learning in Computer Vision for handwritten digit recognition.
- Implement Facial Recognition.
- Implement and understand Motion Analysis & Object Tracking.
- Use basic computational photography techniques for Photo Restoration (eliminate marks, lines, creases, and smudges from old damaged photos).
